# PRD: Zero Theme

## 📋 Executive Summary
Theme Zero is the lightweight, performance-first foundation theme for the PTVX system. It serves as the baseline for all other themes and offers a minimal-overhead interface for systems where rapid data entry and low-latency interaction are prioritized over complex visual aesthetics.

## 👥 Target Personas
- **Developers**: Use Zero as a reference for creating new themes.
- **Back-office Operators**: Need a "distraction-free" environment for data entry.
- **Low-bandwidth Users**: Need a theme optimized for slow network conditions.

## 🎨 Design Tokens
- **Primary Color**: Neutral grayscale system with `#2196F3` (Standard Blue) for actions.
- **Typography**: System default sans-serif stack for maximum compatibility.
- **Density**: High-density layouts by default to maximize information display.
- **Borders**: Minimalist border-based separation instead of shadows.

## ♿ Accessibility Patterns
- **Semantics**: Strict adherence to HTML5 landmark elements.
- **Screen Readers**: Minimalist structure provides the cleanest experience for screen reader users.
- **Color Blindness**: Uses patterns and icons to convey state, not just colors.

## 🎯 Functional Requirements
- **P0: Foundation**: Base CSS utilities and Filament overrides for standard Laraxot operation.
- **P0: Speed**: Zero custom fonts or heavy assets to ensure < 100ms TTI.
- **P1: Compatibility**: Supports legacy browsers and simplified PA workstations.

## ✅ Release Criteria
- Performance: 100/100 Lighthouse score on Desktop/Mobile.
- Zero accessibility violations in automated checks.
